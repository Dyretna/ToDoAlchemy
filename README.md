# ToDoAlchemy

This project is based on the official [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/tutorial/), but has been refactored to use SQLAlchemy and reworked into a simple ToDo application. The authentication system and blueprint structure remain, but all database access is now handled via SQLAlchemy models. The tests have not yet been refactored for SQLAlchemyâ€”this will be addressed in a future version.

## Features

- ToDo list management (create, view, update, delete tasks)
- Full authentication system (register, login, logout)
- Modular blueprint-based structure
- Database integration via SQLAlchemy ORM
- HTML templates using Jinja2
- Easy to extend with new routes, models, or APIs

## Purpose

This repository serves as a modern Flask project template with SQLAlchemy and a basic ToDo app as an example. It's intended as a starting point for your own projects or prototypes.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Jinja2
- SQLite
- `pytest` (tests not yet refactored for SQLAlchemy)
- `coverage`

## Getting Started

Install the project in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Initialize the database:
```bash
flask --app flaskr init-db
```

Run the development server:
```bash
flask --app flaskr run
```

## Testing & Coverage

The tests are not yet updated for SQLAlchemy. This will be improved in a future release.

To run tests and generate a coverage report (HTML):
```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m
coverage html
```

## Code Style & Tooling

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to ensure consistent code style and automatic formatting before each commit.

To enable:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
To manually run on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The following checks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
- black: code formatting
- ruff: linting & autofix
- end-of-line-fixer: final newline enforcement
